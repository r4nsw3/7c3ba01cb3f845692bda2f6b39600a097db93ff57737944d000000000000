----[Release Notes]-------------------------------------:
   
RemiLore is a "rogue-lite" anime-style adventure set in 
a colorful fantasy world where players hack-and-slash 
their way through an army of mechanical monsters using 
a huge variety of unique melee weapons and devastating 
magic attacks!

Remi, an ordinary high school student, has awakened 
Lore, a talking book who is a self-proclaimed "master" 
of magic. Together, they are drawn into the magical 
world of Ragnoah, which has been overtaken by nefarious
mecha-monsters. Remi and Lore must venture together and
find their way home, but can Remi really trust the 
mischievous magic book Lore? Who is the mysterious 
android girl "Choux" and why does she want to capture 
Lore? Will Remi ever find her way out of the magical 
world and return home?

Features single-player story mode with full Japanese 
voice acting, two-player co-op mode, upgradable spells 
and bonus traits, and procedurally-generated levels in 
four beautifully rendered worlds, each based on one of 
the four seasons. Defeating mecha-monsters has its 
rewards, too - players can uncover loads of 
unlockables, including alternate costumes, 200+ 
collectible weapons, New Game+ modes, and more!
